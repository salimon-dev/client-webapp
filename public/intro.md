The concept of universal connectivity is a significant challenge in the information era. The internet has embraced the opportunity to connect people, not in physical places like bars or pubs, but through their computers. It is a marvel designed by developers to unite the world. They created websites, applications, hardware gadgets, and various other devices to ensure people are always connected to the internet and, through it, to each other.

Initially, internet connectivity was a fun hobby for many. Over time, this hobby evolved into a critical component of society. Media streams, government services, academic publishers, and many other sectors embraced the internet to enhance various aspects of their operations. As I write this, every business is either fully or partially connected to the internet.

Imagine being disconnected. I’m not talking about social media and the daily routine of scrolling through short videos. One day, I forgot to take my phone to work. For 30 minutes, between leaving my apartment and reaching my office computer, I was completely offline. During that time, my manager tried to reach me. Later, my landlord called, and I only saw his message when I got home that night. I had a Greek language class in the evening and ended up waiting outside my teacher’s apartment, ringing the bell, unsure if the class was canceled.

The internet is no longer just a side feature of life; it has become an integral part of our daily existence. When we willingly try to exclude it, we step back from being a normal human in today’s society. The internet’s importance to society is comparable to that of water to a living being. It facilitates communication, access to information, and the functioning of various services that we rely on every day. From education and healthcare to business and entertainment, the internet underpins almost every aspect of modern life. Its role is so critical that imagining a day without it feels almost impossible. The internet has transformed from a luxury to a necessity, shaping how we live, work, and interact with the world around us.

We often talk about being connected, but we rarely mention accessibility. The context of the internet is not like an electrical plug on a wall; simply being connected by a wire doesn’t fulfil its purpose. You must be able to use it effectively, and it must provide the resources you need. The internet is a vast amount of data flowing all over our planet. We access this data through various services that allow us to buy, sell, read, communicate, and more. However, for many reasons, we still find ourselves needing to obtain what we want from outside the internet, even though it could be done much faster and more efficiently online.

Accessibility is crucial because it ensures that everyone can benefit from the internet’s vast resources. It’s not just about having a connection; it’s about having the skills, tools, and opportunities to use that connection meaningfully. The internet has the potential to streamline countless tasks and improve efficiency in numerous areas of life, but only if we can access and utilize it properly. As we continue to integrate the internet into our daily lives, addressing accessibility issues becomes increasingly important to ensure that its benefits are available to all.

## Small Businesses

Local businesses in many parts of the world have integrated their services with local service providers. As a tourist, you need to know the names of useful applications and websites to navigate these services. Even if you plan to stay for an extended period, there are still individuals who offer valuable services and products that aren’t listed with these local providers. For instance, you might need the contact information for a plumber or a good comic book shop. To truly know a place as well as a local does can take years.

Imagine you own a barber shop and need to track appointments, either with a notebook or from memory. If you’re a driver, you manage clients and contractors, possibly using your phone or emails. Your clients face similar challenges, keeping track of appointments, tasks, calls, and payments from various local service providers. Managing these details can be overwhelming without the right tools.

The Salimon Network aims to connect people, especially those who are not fully integrated into existing online service providers. These individuals often have a minimal online presence, perhaps just a social media page with an email and phone number. They are not available to respond to their contacts 24/7. Salimon seeks to enhance this connectivity, making it faster and more efficient.

## Traditional and Modern Interfaces

A few decades ago, booking a flight ticket required calling airline agencies and speaking with a representative. You would provide your travel dates and destination, and they would suggest options. You could then choose one of those options, adjust your plans, or ask for the next closest alternatives. Nowadays, the process is quite different. Numerous websites allow you to search for and book flights, offering a comprehensive view of all available options. This shift applies to many other services we now access through the internet.

The linear conversations between providers and customers over the phone have transformed into website interactions where all necessary information is readily available. This significant change occurred because businesses can now serve many more customers with better quality through websites, rather than relying on a limited number of call center staff and keeping customers waiting in line.

Now, we have AI, machine learning, and advanced models. Software and websites can interact with humans in a way that mimics human behavior. In recent years, many websites have started replacing human agents with large language models (LLMs) in their online call centers.

## Regression VS Exploring

The main goal behind most websites and applications we use today is to shift tasks from humans to computers. This led to a solution: replacing 1:1 interactions with 1:n interactions between customers and businesses. As a result, we now have online shops, airlines, booking sites, and other platforms that serve as hubs to explore products and services and find the best deals. We didn’t replace humans with computers; instead, we shifted the task of searching and finding the best options to the customer. Machines can archive all products and services efficiently, but they can’t determine which option suits a customer best.

At Salimon, the goal is to enable users to interact with a single source of information linearly, rather than navigating through multiple pages and forms. Instead of filtering, paginating, and exploring results to find the desired page, product, or service, users can continuously perform regression interactions with the gateway.

Keeping users in a single-threaded interface frees them from having to fully concentrate on complex interfaces. A question-answering process to get what they want can be done on simple gadgets like earphones. Linear interactions can occur through a single-threaded text chat or a virtual call with an entity.

## Entities

I prefer to call them entities. Practically, they are not just typical AI models or mainly large language models (LLMs) serving through the internet. LLMs are like state machines; they provide the same output if given the same input. However, natural AIs are different. They evolve by interacting with their environment, continuously learning from environmental events. Essentially, intelligent entities have six levels of thinking:

1. **Summarisation**: summarise the given input without losing the meaning or maybe slight loss in unrelated parameters.
2. **Distillation**: remove noise input, useless data and categorising patterns in input.
3. **Extraction:** finding key facts like dates, names, places and events.
4. **Characterising:** connecting all extracted data in input and regenerate it based on knowledge graphs.
5. **Analysing:** find out if extracted patterns and events are against the knowledge base and bias them. evaluate the truth of facts base.
6. **Evaluation:** analyse the extracted context against the goal framework of existence. is the input data unrelated to the entity or something that needs an action and output?
7. **Critiquing:** final answer to the series of events as an official output. output does not need to be a interacting answer, most of the times it’s a blank answer and sometimes an effective answer against the event happening in the environment.

These levels evolve as the entity adapts to its environment, resulting in different outcomes over time. This means the entity is a dynamic, intelligent being that can respond to events based on past experiences and what it has learned.

Artificial Intelligence means the model trains based on chunks of data and tries to perform these 7 levels of thinking in a real environment. after examinations by real-life observers, they try to patch the model knowledge based on results and how it performed in tests.

## Data Retrieval and Knowledge Calling

An AI model is essentially a snapshot of a state machine taken immediately after completing its most recent training session. No additional experience or data will be incorporated into this model until the next training cycle. This approach is prevalent today for two main reasons:

1. A model designed for continuous training will encounter uncharted data, which can lead to the loss of foundational knowledge acquired from initial training sessions. This can result in decreased effectiveness and an increase in error rates. In other words, the model may develop a specific focus or “personality” based on the knowledge provided by its environment.
2. Progressive training of models is an expensive operation. It requires advanced hardware, live moderators, and data feeders to train a model effectively. Additionally, there are challenges such as preparing data from various environments and qualifying it as suitable training material.

These two reasons have led to Large Language Models (LLMs) and other AI models used by the public being essentially “frozen” snapshots of their core structures. This approach makes them more cost-effective and reliable for performing tasks.

## Conclusion

An AI model can interact with its environment and respond to requests. By incorporating long-term memories and learning how to utilize them, these models can perform in ways that resemble natural living beings. They can exist on the internet as entities. Like many living creatures, they have a core method of thinking that can be influenced by time and experience, but this core remains unchanged. Mutations do not occur within a single generation but rather over time, evolving to better adapt to environmental elements.

The Salimon Network aims to gather entities with various professions and enable them to live and work together harmoniously with network users. By connecting these entities to essential services used by many across the internet, they can assist us in our daily lives.
